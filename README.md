<!--
EXAMPLE:
This challenge will test your ability to work with nested Objects and Arrays.

Uses [real-world 'inspired' data.](#data)

## Instructions

> TODO: 

**Task:** Complete the functions in [`index.js`](./index.js) and pass all tests specified in [`test/index.test.js`](./test/index.test.js) âœ…


<!--
Example: 

The difficulty increases as you progress.

> Before you begin coding, review provided script files.

**Summary of Functions to Test**

1. `getName(character)` -> `Luke Skywalker`
1. `getFilmCount(character)` -> 5

### Stretch

> TODO: Update/Replace Stretch Goals (see raw README to see tags for expanding section below)

<details>
  <summary> ðŸ’¡ Challenge Yourself! (expand for stretch tips) </summary>


* Research & use different patterns. (Destructuring, move common code into reusable helper methods, functional programming techniques)
* Trade completed code with a peer:
  * Pair program: Take turns (30-60 min.) working through a refactor. Talk through & optimize as needed.
  * Trade code for feedback! (Example format: 3&1, 3 things that you liked and 1 to improve.)
* See how many tests you can pass/complete before Googling or asking for help.
* Time yourself. See if you can beat your own time *starting over.* **Speed run!**
* When you're finished, refactor & improve readability. Write up why it is improved.

## Get Started

3 options are included below.

The CodeSandbox option is fast & highly recommended.

## Hints

#### Helpful tips & reminders ðŸ”Ž

> TODO: Add any tips here - remember to link in the [table of contents](#index) above.

<!-- 
Example:
* **Critical:** Don't make assumptions about input data types. (Convert/handle `Numbers` & `null`)
    * Convert **number strings** into **actual numbers** with built-in functions `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Number`, etc.
* Ensure your functions **`return somethingUseful`.**
* Make sure you understand the requirements. All the words used? Try list the steps in comments first.
* Don't forget the source data uses `snake_case` naming.
* Pay close attention to array vs. object syntax (`vehicles[0].name` vs. `character.vehicles`.)
* Some of the functions include detailed instructions.
* You might have to infer the desired fields. Carefully read the description and function name (description included above the function.)
